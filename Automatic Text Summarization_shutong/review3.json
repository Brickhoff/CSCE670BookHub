{"id": "0517548233", "text": "I don\u2019t know what to do with these stars anymore. I give stars to books and then I think, \u2018god, you give five stars to everything, people will think you are terribly undiscriminating\u2019 \u2013 so then I give four stars or even three stars to some books. Then I look back and it turns out that that I\u2019ve given four stars to Of Human Bondage and honestly, how could I possibly have thought it was a good idea to give that book less than five stars? It is the absurdity of human conventions that has us doing such things.Now, that is what is called a segue, from the Italian \u2018seguire\u2019 \u2013 to follow. For the last thirty years I have studiously avoided reading this book. I have done that because for the last thirty years I have known exactly what this book is about and there just didn\u2019t seem any point in reading it. In high school friends (one of them even became my ex-wife) told me it was a great book about a man condemned to die because he was an outsider. Later I was told that this book was a story about something much like the Azaria Chamberlain case. A case where someone does not react in a way that is considered to be \u2018socially appropriate\u2019 and is therefore condemned.But after 30 years of avoiding reading this book I have finally relented and read it. At first I didn\u2019t think I was going to enjoy it. It didn\u2019t really get off to the raciest of starts and the character's voice \u2013 it is told in first person \u2013 was a bit dull. He is a man who lives entirely in the present, how terribly Buddhist of him \u2013 although, really there doesn\u2019t seem to be all that much to him.My opinion of the book began to change at his mother\u2019s funeral. I particularly liked the man who kept falling behind in the march to the cemetery and would take short cuts. Okay, so it is black humour, but Camus was more or less French \u2013 so black humour is more or less obligatory.I really hadn\u2019t expected this book to be nearly so funny as it turned out. I\u2019d always been told it was a ponderous philosophical text \u2013 and so, to be honest, I was expecting to be bored out of my skull. I wasn\u2019t in the least bit bored.A constant theme in my life at present is that I read \u2018classics\u2019 expecting them to be about something and they end up being about something completely different. And given I\u2019ve called this a \u2018constant\u2019 theme then you might think I would be less than surprised when a read a new \u2018classic\u2019 and it turns out to be completely different to my expectations. I\u2019m a little more upset about this one than some of the others, as I\u2019ve been told about this one before, repeatedly, and by people I\u2019d have taken as \u2018reputable sources\u2019 \u2013 although, frankly, how well one should trust one\u2019s ex-wife in such matters is moot.I had gotten the distinct impression from all of my previous discussions about this book that the guy ends up dead. In fact, this is not the case \u2013 he ends up at the point in his life where he has no idea if he will be freed or not. The Priest who comes to him at the end is actually quite certain that he will be freed. Let\u2019s face it, he is only guilty of having murdered an Arab, and as we have daily evidence, Westerners can murder Arabs with complete impunity. The main point of the book to me is when he realises he is no longer \u2018free\u2019. He needs this explained to him \u2013 because life up until then had been about \u2018getting used to things\u2019 and one can 'get used to just about anything'. But the prison guard helpfully informs him that he is being \u2018punished\u2019 and the manifestation of that punishment is the removal of his \u2018freedom\u2019. Interestingly, he didn\u2019t notice the difference between his past \u2018free\u2019 life and his current \u2018unfree\u2019 one. The most interesting part of the book to me was the very end, the conversation with the priest. The religious often make the mistake of thinking that Atheists are one thing \u2013 I\u2019ve no idea how they ever came to make this mistake, but make it they do. Given that there are thousands upon thousands of different shades of Christians \u2013 from Jesuit Catholics to Anti-Disney Episcopalians \u2013 it should be fairly obvious that something like Atheism (without any \u2018organised\u2019 church or even system of beliefs) could not be in anyway \u2018homogeneous\u2019.I am definitely not the same kind of Atheist as Camus. To Camus there is no truth, the world is essentially absurd and all that exists is the relative truth an individual places on events and ideas. This makes the conversation with the priest fascinatingly interesting. To the priest the prisoner who is facing death is \u2013 by necessity \u2013 someone who is interested in God. You can play around with ideas like the non-existence of God when it doesn\u2019t seem to matter (life is long and blasphemy can seem fun) \u2013 but surely when confronted with the stark truth of the human condition any man would turn away from their disbelief and see the shining light.Not this little black duck. Now, if I was in that cell I would have argued with the priest too \u2013 but I would not have argued in the same way that Meursault argues. No, I do not believe in God, but I do believe in truth, and so Camus\u2019 arguments are barred to me.Meursault essentially says, \u201cLook, I\u2019m bored, I\u2019m totally uninterested in the rubbish you are talking \u2013 now go away\u201d. Now, this is a reasonable response. What is very interesting is that the priest cannot accept this as an answer. The world is not allowed to have such a person in it \u2013 if such a person really did exist then it would be a fundamental challenge to the core beliefs of the priest. So, he has to assume Meursault is either lying to him or is trying to taunt him. But it is much worse \u2013 he is absolutely sincere, he is not interested in this \u2018truth\u2019.I don\u2019t know that the world is completely meaningless, it is conventional rather than meaningless. That those conventions are arbitrary (decided by the culture we grew up in) doesn\u2019t make them meaningless, it makes them conventional. I don\u2019t think I would like to live in a world where people go up and kill Arabs pretty much at random and with impunity, but then again, we have already established this is precisely the world I do live in. My point is that it would be better if we did adhere to some sort of moral principles and that these should be better principles than \u2018he should be killed because he didn\u2019t cry at his mum\u2019s funeral\u2019. Camus is seeking to say that all of our \u2018moral principles\u2019 in the end come to be as meaningless as that \u2013 we judge on the basis of what we see from the framework of our own limited experience. And look, yes, there is much to this \u2013 but this ends up being too easy.The thing I like most about Existentialism, though it isn\u2019t really as evident in this book as it is in the actual philosophy \u2013 although this is something that Meursault is supposed to have grown to understand (sorry, just one more sub-clause) even though this wasn\u2019t something I noticed at all while reading the book, was the notion of responsibility. I didn\u2019t think in the end Meursault was all that much more \u2018responsible\u2019 for his actions than he had been at the start. But I do think that \u2018responsibility\u2019 is a key concept in morality and one that seems increasingly to be ignored.Better by far that we feel responsible for too much in our lives than too little \u2013 better by far that we take responsibility for the actions of our governments (say) than to call these governments \u2018them\u2019. I\u2019m not advocating believing in The Secret - but that if one must err, better to err on the side of believing you have too much responsibility for how your life has turned out, rather than too little.So, what can I say? I enjoyed this much more than I expected \u2013 but I\u2019m still glad I waited before reading it, I really don\u2019t think I would have gotten nearly as much out of it at 15 as I did now."}
